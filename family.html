<font color="7F462C"><font face="brush script MT"><font size="5"><h2 align="center">"We may have our differences, but nothing’s more important than family."</h2>
<center><font color="black"><font face="times new roman"><font size="5">Family is important to every one of us and we all love our family. 
Wherever we go in this world and whatever we may achieve, our heart and soul will always be in our home because it is where our beautiful family is. 
Nothing in this world can be stronger than the bonding of the blood. The members of the same family may have differences of opinions, 
may quarrel often for silly things but in spite of all these it is our family that supports us during our ups and downs.
My family consist of seven members which is my parents, my two elder sisters, my two elder brothers and I am the youngest one. 
In this page, I will show the picture of my family members and a little bit detail about them.</center>

This is my mother.Her name is Huzaimah binti Omar. 
She was born in 28 April 1968 and she is 54 now. She was born in Terengganu and lived in Kelantan after married to my father. 
She is a full-time housewife. My mother can be described as a hardworking, firm but soft in educated her children. 
She also likes to share a story with my father and my other sibling. Other than that, she also like to cook her children’s favorite food. 
For example, she always cook sup tulang which is my favorite dish every time I back home from university for holiday.

This is my first elder brother. His name is Muhammad Asadul Safuan and he is 33 years old. 
Frankly, he grown up with my grandmother in Terengganu and most of his life was spend with my grandmother. 
Hence, I rarely met him as we do not grow together. However, I can describe him as a firm but softspoken person. 
He also married and lived in Terengganu.

This is my first elder sister. Her name is Ainin Sofiya. She is 31 years old and happily married. 
I would say, she has inspired me in a lot of ways. She always helped me with my homework when I was a kid. 
She also inspired me to further my study. She also has a good personality. She is independent, patient, softspoken, hardworking, intelligent, mannered, and talented. 
She is the perfect example of “beauty with brain”. 
Besides, she also a good mother to her children. I adore her very much and want to be like her.

This is my second sister. Her name is Ainna Safina and she is 27 years old this year. 
She is the sibling that I’m most close with. We shared a lot of secrets together and we also have a lot of commons. 
For example, we like to food hunting, take a picture, explore new things and so on. She always supports me for whatever things I do. 
Besides, I also asked for her advise for something that I’m not clear. 
I would say she is type of person that shows love through actions as she always care for me silently.

This is my second brother. His name is Muhammad Abdul Alim. He is 23 years old this year and currently in Shah Alam. 
I would describe my him as a shy person and doesn’t talk a lot. However, he is the person that my family can rely on. 
Sometimes, he also makes a silly joke. In my opinion, if I want to find a partner, I will prefer a man like my brother because he is a good figure for a young man, and it is hard to find a man such as him nowadays. 
It is because he doesn’t smoke and most importantly, he do congregational prayer for five times in mosque.
