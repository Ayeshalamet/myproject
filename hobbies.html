Hobbies are our escape from the real world that makes us forget our worries. I have several hobbies and this page, I will show you my hobbies.</p>

First and foremost, I like to take a picture of everything. Sky, sunset, beach, plants, random scenery and so on.
 For me, every picture that I took hold a different story and it’s felt good when I look back the old picture that I took.

I also love to read. I like books since I was a kid. I can read every genre of the book expect self-help book.
 Bookstore is the most visit place every time I went to the mall. 
I’m currently addicted to Fixi book right now.

Lastly, I like to draw even though I can’t draw and not talented, but I’m just draw random thing just to release the tension. 
Unfortunately, I had to give up this hobby for a while because the cost for all the drawing tools are a bit pricey and I cant afford it. 
I hope someday I can continue to draw.
